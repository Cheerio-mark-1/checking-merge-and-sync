 * Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller
 * subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the
 * sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is also a stable sort, which means that the order of elements with equal values is preserved during the sort.
